# GitHubRxJava
An example using Observable objects as part of the network stack in RxJava.

In this example, we will look at [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/), an HTTP client open sourced by Square which has built-in bindings with RxJava to interact with GitHub’s API. 

Specifically, we’ll create a simple app that presents all the starred repositories for a user given a GitHub username.

This is an exercise repository for the GitHubRxJava example app which is part of the [Meet RxJava: The Missing Reactive Programming Library for Android](https://www.toptal.com/android/functional-reactive-android-rxjava) article.
